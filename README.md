## 🧠 About Me
I am a passionate student developer exploring the intersection of **software development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence**.  
I enjoy building real, working systems—from web applications to machine learning pipelines—and understanding how they perform, scale, and stay secure.

I strongly believe in **learning by building** rather than just reading theory.
